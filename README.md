## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Google Maps API Key with the following APIs enabled:
  - Maps JavaScript API
  - Directions API
  - Places API
  - Geocoding API

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Google Maps API Setup

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the following APIs:
   - Maps JavaScript API
   - Directions API
   - Places API
   - Geocoding API
4. Create credentials (API Key)
5. Optionally, restrict the API key to your domain for security

## Configuration

### Method 1: Environment Variable (Recommended)
Set your Google Maps API key as an environment variable:
```bash
# Windows
set GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# macOS/Linux
export GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### Method 2: Direct Replacement
Edit `app.py` and replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual API key:
```python
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY = 'your_actual_api_key_here'
```

### Method 3: .env File
Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Then install python-dotenv (already in requirements.txt) and add to your app.py:
```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()
```

## Running the Application

1. Start the Flask development server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Professional Ranking Algorithm

The app uses an advanced scoring system to ensure the most reliable and popular attractions are shown first:

### Scoring Components
1. **Star Rating**: Normalized 1-5 star ratings
   - Nearby Places: 70% weight
   - City Search: 65% weight  
   - Route Attractions: 60% weight
2. **Review Count**: Logarithmic scaling to prevent bias toward places with excessive reviews
   - Nearby Places: 30% weight
   - City Search: 35% weight
   - Route Attractions: 40% weight
3. **Quality Bonuses**: Extra points for highly-rated places with substantial review counts
4. **Category Bonuses**: Tourist attractions get slight preference in city searches

### Quality Filters
- **Minimum Rating**: 4.0+ stars required
- **Minimum Reviews**: 5+ for nearby places, 10+ for city attractions
- **Professional Weighting**: Balances popularity with quality

### Result Benefits
- **Reliable Rankings**: Prevents manipulation by fake reviews or rating inflation
- **Popular Destinations**: Ensures well-visited, proven attractions are prioritized
- **Quality Assurance**: Filters out low-quality or questionable establishments
- **Balanced Results**: Combines both rating quality and review volume for trustworthy recommendations

## Smart Route Focus

When searching for attractions along your travel route, the app intelligently focuses on the middle portion of your journey:

### Why Middle-Route Focus?
- **Discovery Purpose**: Travelers want to see new places during their journey, not near familiar start/end points
- **Practical Planning**: Attractions near your origin or destination are likely already known or easily accessible
- **Journey Enhancement**: Focus on the main travel experience rather than departure/arrival areas

### How It Works
- **Route Analysis**: The app calculates the total distance of your route
- **Smart Filtering**: Only searches for attractions in the middle 60% of the route
- **Exclusion Zones**: Skips the first 20% and last 20% of your journey
- **Optimal Discovery**: Ensures attractions are in the most relevant part of your travel experience

### Example
```
Route: New York ‚Üí Boston (215 miles)
- First 20%: Miles 0-43 (near NYC) ‚Üí Excluded
- Middle 60%: Miles 43-172 ‚Üí Attractions shown here
- Last 20%: Miles 172-215 (near Boston) ‚Üí Excluded
```

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Enter`: Calculate travel time when focused on input fields
- `Ctrl/Cmd + Enter`: Calculate travel time from anywhere
- `Ctrl/Cmd + S`: Swap origin and destination locations

## Customization

### Styling
Edit `static/style.css` to customize the appearance. The app uses:
- Modern gradient backgrounds
- Card-based layout
- Responsive grid system
- Custom animations

### Map Styling
The map uses custom styling defined in `static/script.js`. You can modify the `styles` array in the `initMap()` function to change the map appearance.

### Additional Features
You can extend the app by:
- Adding more travel modes (walking, cycling)
- Implementing route optimization for multiple stops
- Adding traffic information
- Saving favorite routes
- Adding cost estimation for transit

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Map not loading**: Check if your API key is correctly set and has the required APIs enabled
2. **No routes found**: Ensure the locations are valid and accessible by the selected travel mode
3. **Transit times not available**: Public transit information may not be available for all locations
4. **CORS errors**: Make sure you're accessing the app through `localhost:5000` and not opening the HTML file directly

### API Quotas
Google Maps APIs have usage quotas. For development:
- Maps JavaScript API: 28,000 loads per month
- Directions API: 2,500 requests per day
- Places API: 17,000 requests per month

Monitor your usage in the Google Cloud Console.
